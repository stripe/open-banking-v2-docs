# Overview
### Glossary

### Account Information
When used in Open Banking, ​Account information​ refers to an API that gives access to account and transaction information. To gain that access there needs to be two types of authorisation. On one side, the entity accessing the API must be an authorised institution (known as an AISP). On the other side, the person or business that owns that account (called the PCU) must give the AISP permission to access that specific account.

### AISP
An AISP (Account Information Service Provider) is authorised by a competent authority to access the account and transaction information of individuals and businesses who have given it permission do so. An AISP might use this access to provide a aggregation service, for example, allowing people to see several of their bank accounts in one place.

### AML
Anti-money laundering processes, regulations and laws.

### ASPSP
The ASPSPs (Account Servicing Payment Service Providers) are the account providers. These APIs provide access to customer account information (for example, to AISPs) and also allow third-party providers (TPPs) to initiate payments from the account provider’s customers’ accounts.

The customer must give specific permission to the entity that wants to access their account information and initiate payments on their behalf.


There are two types of ASPSP:


Mandatory: in the UK, these are the initial nine banks that are taking part in Open Banking.
Voluntary: these are institutions that have chosen to take part in Open Banking.
